## Maryland Electrification Index
### Portfolio Assessment Proposal

**Prepared for:** [Fund Name]
**Prepared by:** Max | MBRACE Intelligence
**Date:** [Date]
**Valid through:** [Date + 30 days]

---

## Executive Summary

[Fund Name] has identified Maryland multifamily assets as a strategic focus. With Maryland's Zero Emission Heating and Equipment Standard (ZEHES) triggering heat pump replacement requirements by 2029, your portfolio faces material capex exposure that current underwriting may not fully capture.

MBRACE Intelligence proposes a Portfolio Electrification Assessment to:

1. Quantify asset-level compliance risk across your Maryland holdings
2. Model incentive capture potential ($15,000-$30,000/unit for qualifying properties)
3. Develop a phased execution roadmap that maximizes incentive capture while minimizing operational disruption

**Investment:** $[Amount] (see Pricing section)
**Timeline:** [X] weeks
**Deliverables:** Asset-level risk stratification, incentive model, execution roadmap, executive briefing

## The Regulatory Context

### Maryland's Building Electrification Mandate

Maryland has enacted the most aggressive building decarbonization policy on the East Coast:

| Milestone | Date | Implication |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Zero-Emission Buildings MOU | 2024 | State commits to 65% heat pump sales by 2030 |
| Clean Heat Rules Phase-In | 2025-26 | EmPOWER redesign, enhanced incentives |
| ZEHES Full Enforcement | ~2029 | End-of-life HVAC = heat pump required |
| State Target | 2030 | 95% heat pump market share |

### Why This Matters for Your Portfolio

For a typical 1,000-unit Maryland portfolio:

- **Gross electrification capex:** $15-20M ($15-20K/unit)
- **Current incentive capture (if optimized):** $10-15M (50-75%)
- **Net owner investment:** $5-10M
- **Risk of waiting:** Incentive programs cap out, contractor capacity constrained, emergency pricing (+35-50%)

Properties with HVAC systems approaching end-of-life face mandatory heat pump installation under ZEHES. Proactive planning captures maximum incentives; reactive replacement captures minimum.

## Proposed Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Inventory (Week 1-2)

**Objective:** Build comprehensive asset-level database of Maryland holdings

**Activities:**
- Property list ingestion (address, unit count, building type, year built)
- HVAC system inventory (equipment type, age, condition if known)
- Utility territory mapping (BGE, Pepco, Potomac Edison, SMECO)
- Tenant income profile assessment (AMI classification by unit)

**Client Inputs Required:**
- Property list with addresses and unit counts
- Available HVAC equipment data (from property management or maintenance records)
- Tenant income data or reasonable proxy (for IRA HEEHR eligibility)

**Deliverable:** Verified property database with system-level detail

---

### Phase 2: Risk Stratification & Incentive Modeling (Week 2-3)

**Objective:** Score each asset for compliance risk and incentive eligibility

**Risk Scoring Methodology:**
- System age (weight: 40%)
- Current fuel type (weight: 25%)
- Building vintage and envelope condition (weight: 15%)
- Tenant income profile (weight: 10%)
- Utility territory incentive levels (weight: 10%)

**Incentive Modeling:**
- EmPOWER utility rebates (by utility, equipment type, income tier)
- IRA HEEHR federal rebates (100% for ≤80% AMI, 50% for 80-150% AMI)
- DHCD MEEHA state grants (for affordable housing)
- MEA supplemental programs

**Output:** Asset-level matrix with:
- Compliance risk score (0-100)
- Estimated system EOL year
- Incentive eligibility by program
- Total incentive capture potential (low/high range)
- Net owner investment estimate

---

### Phase 3: Execution Roadmap & Financial Model (Week 3-4)

**Objective:** Develop actionable implementation plan

**Roadmap Components:**
- Priority tiers (immediate, 12-month, 24-month, monitor)
- Sequencing recommendations (which assets first, why)
- Application timing (align with program cycles)
- Contractor capacity considerations by geography

**Financial Model:**
- Year-by-year capex projection
- Incentive capture by year
- Net cash flow impact
- ROI and payback analysis
- Sensitivity scenarios (incentive reduction, cost escalation)

**Deliverable:** Excel model with scenario toggles + narrative roadmap document

---

### Phase 4: Executive Briefing & Handoff (Week 4)

**Objective:** Present findings and transfer knowledge to internal team

**Activities:**
- 90-minute executive briefing (virtual or in-person)
- Walk-through of deliverables
- Q&A with investment and asset management teams
- Handoff of all models, data, and documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Executive summary presentation (10-15 slides)
- Full portfolio assessment report (PDF)
- Asset-level database (Excel/Airtable)
- Financial model (Excel)
- Roadmap document (PDF)
