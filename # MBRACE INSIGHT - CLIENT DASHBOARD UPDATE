### SECTION 11: ATTRIBUTION MODEL EXPLANATION

**How We Track Revenue**

Explains the methodology:
- Each lead is tagged with source at origin
- Source is tracked through estimate to conversion
- Revenue is attributed back to originating source
- Customer lifetime value is calculated: Initial job + repeat service + referrals

Example journey:
```
Customer found you on Google LSA (Tuesday 2pm)
→ You called back within 8 minutes
→ Gave estimate ($12,000)
→ Followed up Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 via our automation
→ Customer decided Day 5
→ Job completed
→ Revenue: $12,000 → Google LSA

Year 2: Customer calls for maintenance
→ Revenue: $1,200 → Attributed to original LSA source

Year 2: Customer refers two neighbors
→ They both become customers
→ Revenue: $24,000 → Attributed to original LSA source (via referral)

Total Customer LTV from single LSA lead: $37,200
```
