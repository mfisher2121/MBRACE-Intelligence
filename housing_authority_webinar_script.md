## SCRIPT

### [0:00-2:00] Welcome & Introduction

**[SLIDE 1: Title slide]**

> "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm Max from MBRACE Intelligence, and I'm here to share a free tool that can help the property owners in your network navigate Maryland's heat pump incentive landscape.
>
> Quick agenda: I'll spend about 20 minutes walking through what's happening with Maryland's electrification rules, what incentives are available, and then I'll do a live demo of the calculator we built. Then we'll have time for questions.
>
> Before we dive in — a quick note on what we are and aren't. MBRACE is an intelligence service. We're not contractors, we don't sell equipment, and we don't take referral fees from installers. Our job is to help property owners understand their options. What they do with that information is up to them.
>
> Alright, let's get into it."

### [2:00-7:00] The Problem Your Owners Face

**[SLIDE 2: The Problem]**

> "So here's the situation you're probably already seeing.
>
> Property owners are confused. They've heard something about heat pump mandates, or rebates, or tax credits — but they don't know what applies to them, how much they'd get, or when they need to act.
>
> They're also worried. Worried about emergency HVAC replacements. Worried about contractor pressure tactics. Worried about rising costs.
>
> And they don't have time to research five different programs, figure out which ones stack, and navigate the application process.
>
> So what happens? They do nothing. They wait until their system fails, then they pay emergency pricing — which is 35 to 50 percent higher than a planned replacement — and they miss most of the incentives because they didn't apply in advance."

**[SLIDE 3: The Cost of Waiting]**

> "Let me put some numbers on this.
>
> A typical heat pump installation runs $12,000 to $20,000 depending on the building. Right now, with stacked incentives, most property owners can get $8,000 to $14,000 back — sometimes more for income-qualified properties.
>
> That means their net cost could be as low as $0 to $6,000.
>
> But if they wait until the system fails? They're paying full price, in winter, with limited contractor availability. And by then, program budgets may be exhausted.
>
> The window for maximum incentive capture is now. Not 2028. Now."

---

### [7:00-12:00] Maryland's Regulatory Timeline

**[SLIDE 4: Timeline]**

> "Let me give you the regulatory context, because this is driving everything.
>
> In 2024, Maryland signed the Zero-Emission Buildings Memorandum of Understanding. This commits the state to 65% heat pump market share by 2030, and 90% by 2040.
>
> That's not a suggestion. That's a policy target with regulatory mechanisms behind it.
>
> The main mechanism is called ZEHES — the Zero Emission Heating and Cooling Equipment Standard. What this means in practice is that when a fossil fuel HVAC system reaches end-of-life — when it fails and needs replacement — the replacement has to be a heat pump.
>
> So if you have a property owner with a 20-year-old gas furnace, they're not going to be able to replace it with another gas furnace once ZEHES is fully enforced.
>
> The phase-in starts in 2025-2026. Full enforcement is expected around 2029."

**[SLIDE 5: What This Means]**

> "Here's the practical implication.
>
> For property owners with systems less than 10 years old — they have time. They should monitor the situation but don't need to rush.
>
> For systems 10 to 15 years old — they should start planning. These systems will likely need replacement within the mandate window.
>
> For systems 15 years or older — this is high priority. These systems could fail any time, and acting now captures maximum incentives.
>
> This is why we built the calculator — to help property owners understand which bucket they're in and what their specific incentive eligibility looks like."

### [12:00-17:00] The Incentive Landscape

**[SLIDE 6: Available Programs]**

> "Now let's talk about what's actually available.
>
> There are three layers of incentives that can stack together.
>
> **Layer one: Utility rebates through EmPOWER Maryland.** BGE, Pepco, Potomac Edison, SMECO — they all offer rebates ranging from $2,000 to $8,000 depending on the utility, the equipment, and income level.
>
> **Layer two: Federal incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act.** For income-qualified households — under 80% of area median income — the HEEHR program can cover up to $8,000 to $14,000. For higher-income households, there's still the 25C tax credit worth up to $2,000.
>
> **Layer three: State programs.** MEA grants, DHCD programs for affordable housing, and other supplemental funding.
>
> When you stack these together, you're looking at $8,000 to $25,000 or more in total incentives, depending on the property type and income level."

**[SLIDE 7: Affordable Housing Example]**

> "For affordable housing specifically — LIHTC properties, Section 8, public housing — the numbers can be even better.
>
> Because the tenants are income-qualified, these properties can access the maximum federal rebates. Combined with EmPOWER and DHCD programs, we're seeing 50% to 100% coverage in some cases.
>
> For a 100-unit portfolio, that could mean $1.5 million or more in incentives against a $2 million project cost.
>
> The key is applying in the right sequence. The wrong order can leave money on the table."

### [17:00-22:00] Live Calculator Demo

**[SLIDE 8: Calculator Introduction]**

> "Alright, let me show you the tool.
>
> [SWITCH TO BROWSER - Calculator open]
>
> This is the incentive calculator we built. Property owners answer six questions — address, building type, utility, current heating system, system age, and household income range.
>
> Let me walk through it with a sample property.
>
> [FILL OUT CALCULATOR LIVE]
>
> Address: Let's say 123 Main Street, Baltimore, 21201
> Building type: Single family
> Utility: BGE
> Current heating: Natural gas
> System age: 15-20 years
> Income level: Under 80% AMI
>
> [SUBMIT]
>
> And here's what they see — a breakdown of which programs they likely qualify for, with estimated amounts.
>
> [SHOW RESULTS]
>
> EmPOWER: $4,000 to $8,000
> Federal HEEHR: $8,000 to $14,000
> Total: $12,000 to $22,000
>
> Now, within a couple hours, they'll receive a PDF report with more detail, including the application sequence and next steps.
>
> [SHOW SAMPLE PDF REPORT]
>
> This is what the report looks like. Program-by-program breakdown, estimated timeline, and a checklist of what they need to do next.
>
> The whole process takes about 2 minutes for the property owner. No contractor visit required, no one calling to sell them anything."

### [22:00-25:00] How This Helps Housing Authorities

**[SLIDE 9: Benefits for HAs]**

> "So how does this help you?
>
> **First: fewer confused calls.** Property owners get answers from the calculator instead of calling you.
>
> **Second: better outcomes.** Owners who understand their incentives are more likely to act before systems fail, which means less disruption for tenants and lower costs overall.
>
> **Third: zero cost to you.** This is free for you to share and free for property owners to use. We're not asking you to buy anything or commit to anything.
>
> What we're asking is simple: share the calculator link with your property owner network. We can give you a custom URL so you can track how many people from your referrals are using it.
>
> If you want to co-brand it — put your logo on a landing page — we can do that too. Or if you'd prefer, I can present directly to your property owners in a webinar like this one."

**[SLIDE 10: Next Steps]**

> "Here's how to get started.
>
> **Option 1:** I'll send you the calculator link after this call. Share it however makes sense — email, newsletter, your website.
>
> **Option 2:** If you want a co-branded version or a custom landing page, let me know and we'll set that up.
>
> **Option 3:** If you'd like me to present directly to your property owners, we can schedule that.
>
> Any of those options work. The goal is just to get this information into the hands of people who need it before they're stuck with an emergency replacement and missed incentives."

### [25:00-30:00] Q&A

> "Alright, that's the overview. Let's open it up for questions.
>
> [PAUSE - Wait for questions]
>
> [If no questions immediately:]
> 
> While you're thinking, let me address a couple questions I usually get..."

---

## Common Q&A

### "How do you make money from this?"

> "Great question. The free calculator is how we build our dataset. We aggregate anonymized data — utility territory, system age, building type — to track market trends. That intelligence is valuable to policymakers and investors who want to understand Maryland's electrification readiness.
>
> We also offer premium products for large portfolio owners — detailed asset-level analysis, compliance roadmaps, that kind of thing. But for individual property owners and housing authorities, the calculator is free."

### "What happens to the data property owners submit?"

> "Individual data is used only to generate their personalized report. We don't sell individual property owner data to contractors or anyone else. We don't share their contact info with third parties.
>
> What we do aggregate is anonymized market data — how many submissions per utility territory, what system ages people are reporting, that kind of thing. No personally identifiable information."

### "How accurate are the estimates?"

> "The calculator provides ranges, not guarantees. Actual rebate amounts depend on specific equipment choices, contractor quotes, and program availability at the time of application.
>
> We're conservative in our estimates — we'd rather under-promise and over-deliver. But the ranges are based on current published program parameters and are updated as programs change."

### "Will contractors contact property owners after they submit?"

> "No. We don't share submissions with contractors. Property owners receive their report from us, and then it's their choice whether to get quotes, which contractors to contact, and when to move forward. We're not in the contractor referral business."

### "Can we see aggregate data from our referrals?"

> "Yes, if you use a custom tracking link, we can share anonymized aggregate stats — number of submissions, breakdown by building type, average incentive eligibility. We won't share individual property owner information, but you can see the overall picture of how your network is engaging."

### "What if property owners have questions after they get their report?"

> "They can reply to the email or text and a real person will respond. For complex questions — like specific program application processes — we point them to the official program administrators. We're not licensed to give financial or legal advice, but we can help them understand their options."

## Closing

> "Any other questions?
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> Alright, I'll send a follow-up email with the recording, the slide deck, and the calculator link. If you have questions later, just reply to that email.
>
> Thanks everyone for your time today. I hope this is useful for your property owner network."
