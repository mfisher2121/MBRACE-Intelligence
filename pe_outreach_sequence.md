## EMAIL 1: The Problem Frame

**Subject lines (test):**
- Maryland's ZEHES mandate — what it means for {{company_name}}'s portfolio
- Your Maryland multifamily exposure and the 2029 electrification trigger
- The capex line item you're probably not modeling yet

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick question: has {{company_name}} modeled electrification capex for your Maryland multifamily holdings?

Maryland's ZEHES mandate triggers heat pump replacement when HVAC systems reach end-of-life — likely within 5-8 years for most portfolios. For a 1,000-unit Maryland portfolio, that's $15-20M in gross capex on the horizon.

The complicating factor: right now, incentives cover 50-70% of that cost. But as demand spikes post-2026, program caps and contractor capacity will compress that window.

I've been building a dataset — property-level system age, utility territory, incentive eligibility — that helps funds model this exposure. Happy to share what we're seeing if your team is thinking about this.

Best,
Max

## EMAIL 2: The Credibility Play

**Subject:** Re: Maryland's ZEHES mandate

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Following up on my note about Maryland electrification exposure.

To give you a sense of what we track:

**Maryland Electrification Index**
- Property-level HVAC system age and fuel type
- Utility territory mapping (BGE, Pepco, Potomac Edison, SMECO)
- Incentive eligibility by program (EmPOWER, IRA HEEHR, DHCD/MEEHA)
- Compliance timeline risk scoring (0-100)
- Contractor capacity by geography

We've compiled this for 500+ Maryland properties through direct owner engagement — data that doesn't exist in CoStar or public records.

For funds with Maryland MF exposure, we offer portfolio-level assessments: asset-by-asset risk stratification, incentive capture modeling, and phased execution roadmaps.

Would a sample analysis for one of your Maryland properties be useful? Just reply with an address and I'll run it.

## EMAIL 3: The Illustrative Analysis

**Subject:** What electrification looks like for a 500-unit Maryland portfolio

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Wanted to share a quick illustrative analysis — the kind of output we produce for funds with Maryland exposure.

**Sample: 500-Unit Maryland MF Portfolio**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross electrification capex | ~$10M ($20K/unit) |
| Incentive capture (stacked) | ~$6.5M (65%) |
| Net owner investment | ~$3.5M ($7K/unit) |
| Annual energy savings | ~$350K |
| Simple payback (net) | ~10 years |
| 15-year net benefit vs. waiting | ~$2.8M |

**Risk stratification:**
- 18% of units (90) have systems likely to fail before 2029 — HIGH priority
- 52% of units (260) are 10-15 years old — MODERATE priority
- 30% of units (150) are <10 years old — MONITOR

This is the level of detail we provide for each property in a portfolio assessment.

If {{company_name}} has Maryland exposure, I'd be happy to run a real analysis on your holdings. Takes about 2 weeks to deliver, starts at $15K for portfolios under 50 assets.

Worth a 15-minute call to discuss?

Max

P.S. We also offer deal-level electrification memos for acquisitions — $2,500/asset, 48-hour turnaround.

## EMAIL 4: The Breakup

**Subject:** Should I close the loop?

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've sent a few notes about Maryland electrification exposure for PE portfolios — wanted to make sure I'm not cluttering your inbox.

If this isn't relevant to {{company_name}} right now, no worries. I'll close the loop here.

If you'd like to revisit later, or if you have a colleague who handles asset management or capex planning, feel free to forward this thread.

Either way, thanks for your time.

Best,
Max
MBRACE Intelligence

P.S. If you'd prefer I reach out again in 6 months when more mandate details are finalized, just reply "later" and I'll set a reminder.

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES

### If They Reply Positively (Interested)

**Response template:**
```
Great to hear from you, {{first_name}}.

A few options depending on where you are:

1. **Free sample**: I can run one of your Maryland properties through our Index and send you a sample asset-level report. Just reply with an address.

2. **Portfolio assessment call**: If you want to discuss your full Maryland exposure, I can walk you through our methodology and pricing on a 20-minute call. [CALENDLY LINK]

3. **Deal-level memo**: If you have an acquisition in diligence, we can turn around an electrification risk/opportunity analysis in 48 hours. $2,500/asset.

Which sounds most useful?

Max
```

### If They Reply "Not Now" / "Bad Timing"

**Response template:**
```
Totally understand, {{first_name}}. Happy to reconnect when timing is better.

I'll set a reminder to follow up in [3/6] months — or feel free to reach out directly if something comes up before then.

In the meantime, if you want to keep tabs on Maryland's electrification landscape, our quarterly regulatory briefings are free to subscribe: [LINK]

Best,
Max
```

### If They Reply "Who Are You?"

**Response template:**
```
Fair question, {{first_name}}.

MBRACE Intelligence is a data and intelligence service focused on Maryland's building electrification market. We help PE funds, asset managers, and housing authorities understand:

- Which properties face mandate compliance risk
- What incentive programs apply (and how to capture them)
- How to sequence and prioritize electrification capex

We're not contractors — we don't install equipment or sell hardware. We provide data and analysis.

I reached out because {{company_name}} appears to have Maryland multifamily exposure, and this is the kind of regulatory shift that often gets missed until it's too late to capture incentives.

Happy to share more context if useful. Or if I have the wrong read on your portfolio, just let me know and I'll update my records.

Max

## LINKEDIN OUTREACH (Supplement)

### Connection Request
```
Hi {{first_name}} — I focus on regulatory capex exposure for PE funds with Maryland real estate. Thought we might have some overlap given {{company_name}}'s portfolio. Happy to connect.
```

### First Message (After Connection)
```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}.

Quick question: is {{company_name}} tracking Maryland's ZEHES mandate? It triggers heat pump replacement when HVAC systems reach end-of-life — could be $15-20K/unit in capex for multifamily portfolios.

I've been building a dataset on property-level exposure. Happy to share what we're seeing if your team is thinking about this.
```

### Follow-Up (If No Response After 5 Days)
```
{{first_name}} — didn't want to leave you hanging.

If Maryland electrification isn't on your radar yet, no worries. But if you'd find a sample asset-level analysis useful, just reply with a property address and I'll run it through our Index.

Either way, appreciate you connecting.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have consultants for this."

> Totally fair. The difference is our data source — we capture property-level system age and incentive eligibility through direct owner engagement, not public records or estimates. If your consultants are working off CoStar data, they're missing the ground-truth inputs that drive accuracy. Happy to compare methodologies if you'd find that useful.

### "We're not focused on Maryland."

> Makes sense. We're starting with Maryland because the mandate is most advanced here, but the playbook applies to any state adopting building performance standards. If you have exposure in DC, Virginia, New York, or California, the regulatory pattern is similar — just on different timelines. Let me know if those geographies are more relevant.

### "This feels premature — the mandate isn't enforced yet."

> That's exactly the window we're focused on. Right now, incentives cover 50-70% of costs and contractor capacity is available. Post-2026, as demand spikes, those economics compress. The funds positioning now are locking in favorable execution costs. The question is whether you want to model this proactively or react when systems fail.

### "What's your data source?"

> We capture data through a public calculator that property owners use to check their incentive eligibility. They provide address, building type, utility territory, system age, and income classification. We've compiled 500+ Maryland properties this way — data that doesn't exist in any commercial database because it comes from direct owner engagement.
