## SEQUENCE 1: LIHTC / Affordable Housing Owners

### Target
- Property owners, asset managers, or principals at firms with LIHTC, Section 8, or affordable housing in Maryland
- List source: HUD LIHTC Database, state housing finance agency records, CoStar (filter: MF + LLC/Fund owner)

### Email 1: The Opener
**Subject lines (test 2-3):**
- Maryland's forcing heat pump conversions — here's what that means for {{company_name}}
- Your {{property_count}} Maryland properties qualify for ~$20K/unit in incentives
- The math on Maryland's electrification mandate (for {{company_name}})

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Maryland's ZEHES mandate will require heat pump replacement when your HVAC systems reach end-of-life — likely within the next 5-8 years for most affordable housing portfolios.

The good news: right now, EmPOWER + IRA HEEHR + DHCD programs stack to cover 50-100% of conversion costs for income-qualified properties. That window won't stay open.

I built a calculator that shows property-level incentive eligibility for Maryland multifamily. Happy to run your portfolio through it — takes about 2 minutes on your end, no cost.

Here's the link if you want to try it yourself: [CALCULATOR LINK]

Or just reply and I'll send a sample report for one of your properties.

Best,
Max

P.S. We're an intelligence service, not a contractor. No sales pitch, no one calling to sell you equipment.

### Email 2: The Follow-Up (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Maryland's forcing heat pump conversions

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up — did my last note land?

The short version: Maryland affordable housing portfolios are sitting on $15,000-$25,000/unit in stackable incentives that most owners don't claim because the application sequence is confusing.

I've mapped out the exact order (EmPOWER pre-approval → IRA HEEHR → DHCD/MEEHA) that maximizes capture.

If you have even 50 units in Maryland, that's $750K-$1.25M in potential offsets to your electrification capex.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it applies to your portfolio?

### Email 3: The Case Study (Day 7)
**Subject:** How a 200-unit Baltimore portfolio captured $4.2M in incentives

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Wanted to share a quick case study relevant to your Maryland holdings.

A 200-unit LIHTC portfolio in Baltimore County:
- Gross electrification cost: ~$4M ($20K/unit)
- EmPOWER rebates: $1.2M
- IRA HEEHR (100% AMI-qualified): $2.4M
- DHCD/MEA grants: $600K
- **Net owner cost: ~$800K ($4K/unit)**
- Annual energy savings: $140K

The key was application sequencing — wrong order and they would have left ~$1M on the table.

I can run a similar analysis for {{company_name}}'s Maryland properties. Just reply with a property address and I'll send a sample report.

### Email 4: The Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've sent a few notes about Maryland's heat pump incentives for affordable housing — wanted to close the loop.

If the timing isn't right, no worries. I'll keep your info on file and reach out if program rules change significantly.

If you'd rather I not follow up, just reply "remove" and I'll take you off my list.

Otherwise, the calculator is here whenever you're ready: [CALCULATOR LINK]

## SEQUENCE 2: Nonprofit Facility Managers

### Target

- List source: IRS Form 990 filings (filter by MD address, NTEE code for churches/schools/clinics/community orgs)

### Email 1: The Opener
**Subject lines (test 2-3):**
- {{org_name}} may qualify for $25,000-$100,000 in building grants
- Maryland is paying nonprofits to upgrade HVAC — here's how
- Free money for {{org_name}}'s building (seriously)

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I came across {{org_name}} while researching Maryland nonprofits that might qualify for the state's building electrification grants.

The short version: MEA's ECB and EEE grant programs can cover 70-100% of heat pump and insulation costs for 501(c)(3) community-serving facilities. Churches, schools, clinics, and community centers are all eligible.

Most nonprofits don't know these programs exist, or assume the application is too complicated. It's actually straightforward if you follow the right sequence.

I built a free eligibility scanner that shows which programs apply to your building: [CALCULATOR LINK]

Takes 2 minutes. No contractors, no sales calls — just your grant eligibility breakdown.

Let me know if you have questions.

Best,
Max

### Email 2: The Follow-Up (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: {{org_name}} may qualify for building grants

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note about Maryland's nonprofit building grants.

Here's what {{org_name}} might be looking at:
- **MEA ECB Grant:** Up to $50K for heat pumps and electrical upgrades
- **MEA EEE Grant:** Additional funding for insulation and air sealing
- **EmPOWER Rebates:** $3K-$15K from your utility (BGE, Pepco, etc.)

These programs are first-come, first-served. Organizations that apply early in the grant cycle capture the most funding.

Would it help if I sent you a one-page checklist of what's required? Just reply "checklist" and I'll send it over.

### Email 3: The Urgency Frame (Day 8)
**Subject:** Before Maryland's rules change

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick note — Maryland's Clean Heat Rules begin phasing in 2025-2026. After that, grant programs will see higher demand and faster cap-outs.

The organizations applying now are locking in 70-100% coverage. The organizations waiting will face stiffer competition and potentially lower funding levels.

If {{org_name}} has any plans to upgrade HVAC, insulation, or water heating in the next 3-5 years, now is the time to explore grant eligibility.

Here's the free scanner: [CALCULATOR LINK]

Or just reply and I'll run your building address manually.

### Email 4: The Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Should I stop reaching out?

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've sent a few notes about Maryland's building grants for nonprofits — wanted to make sure I'm not cluttering your inbox.

If this isn't relevant for {{org_name}} right now, just reply "remove" and I'll take you off my list.

If the timing just isn't right, no worries — the scanner will be here when you're ready: [CALCULATOR LINK]

Thanks for your time either way.

## SEQUENCE 3: Cold LinkedIn Messages (Both Segments)

### Connection Request

Hi {{first_name}} — I focus on Maryland building electrification incentives for [affordable housing owners / nonprofits]. Thought we might have some overlap. Happy to connect.
```

### Follow-Up Message (after connection)
```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}.

Quick question: does {{company_name}} have any Maryland properties you're thinking about electrifying in the next few years?

I've been mapping the incentive landscape — EmPOWER + IRA + state grants stack to 50-100% coverage for qualifying buildings. Happy to share what I've learned if it's relevant.
```

### If They Respond Positively
```
Great — easiest thing is probably this calculator I built: [LINK]

Takes 2 minutes, shows property-level eligibility. No contractors involved, just the incentive breakdown.

Or if you prefer, I can run an address manually and send you a sample report.
