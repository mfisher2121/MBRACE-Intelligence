# MARYLAND ELECTRIFICATION INDEX™
## Product Specification & Intelligence Offering

---

## Executive Summary

The **Maryland Electrification Index** is a proprietary intelligence product that translates Maryland's building decarbonization mandate into actionable portfolio-level risk and opportunity metrics.

Unlike consultant reports based on public data, the Index is built from **ground-truth building intelligence** captured through direct property owner engagement — data that cannot be scraped, purchased, or replicated.

**Target buyers:** Private equity funds, asset managers, and institutional owners with Maryland multifamily, affordable housing, or commercial real estate exposure.

## The Problem We Solve

### What PE Funds Don't Know (But Need To)

| Question | Current State | MBRACE Answer |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Which assets face forced replacement by 2029? | Unknown — no system age data at scale | Property-level HVAC age + fuel type → ZEHES timeline mapping |
| What's the incentive capture ceiling per asset? | Guesswork based on program maximums | Actual eligibility by utility territory + income classification |
| Where is incentive capacity already saturated? | No visibility | Real-time program uptake signals from calculator submissions |
| Which contractors can execute in our territory? | RFP process for each deal | Contractor readiness database by certification + capacity |

### The Core Insight

Maryland's mandate creates **predictable, forced capex** across building portfolios. The only decisions are:

1. **When** (proactive vs. reactive)
2. **At what cost** (incentive-optimized vs. emergency pricing)
3. **With what operational disruption** (planned vs. crisis)

The Index turns this regulatory certainty into **quantified risk curves** and **prioritized action roadmaps**.

## Product Architecture

### 1. Maryland Electrification Readiness Index (MERI)

**What it is:** A composite score (0-100) measuring a portfolio's preparedness for Maryland's building electrification mandate.

**Components:**

| Factor | Weight | Data Source |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| System Age Risk | 30% | Average HVAC age vs. ZEHES timeline triggers |
| Fuel Exposure | 25% | % of portfolio on high-risk fuels (oil, propane, resistance) |
| Incentive Capture Potential | 25% | Stacked incentive eligibility by asset |
| Contractor Readiness | 10% | Local EmPOWER-certified contractor density |
| Regulatory Timeline Alignment | 10% | Current compliance status vs. mandate milestones |

**Output:** Single portfolio score + asset-level breakdown

**Benchmark comparison:** How portfolio compares to Maryland affordable housing, market-rate MF, and nonprofit building cohorts.

### 2. Asset-Level Risk Stratification

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor Type | What They Offer | MBRACE Advantage |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Big 4 Consulting | Generic policy analysis, high fees | Ground-truth data, 5x lower cost, operational SOPs |
| ESG Rating Agencies | Backward-looking scores | Forward-looking mandate risk, asset-level granularity |

**Our moat:** Proprietary dataset from direct property owner engagement. This data does not exist in public records, CoStar, or consultant databases.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Portfolio Data Intake
Share property list (address, unit count, building type) via secure upload.

### Step 2: Data Enhancement
We cross-reference against our dataset and public records to pre-populate known attributes.

### Step 3: Gap-Fill Survey
For properties not in our dataset, we deploy targeted calculator to capture missing data points (system age, fuel type, etc.).

### Step 4: Analysis & Scoring
Run MERI scoring model, generate asset-level risk stratification, build custom heat maps.

### Step 5: Delivery & Briefing
Deliver report package, conduct findings call, provide ongoing access to dashboard.

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks depending on portfolio size and data availability.
