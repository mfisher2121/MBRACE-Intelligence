## WEEK 1: Foundation

### Monday — Regulatory
**Hook:** Maryland just set the most aggressive heat pump timeline on the East Coast.

**Body:**
The 2024 Zero-Emission Buildings MOU commits Maryland to:
→ 65% heat pump sales by 2030
→ 90% by 2040

What this means for property owners:

1. Your next HVAC replacement will likely be a heat pump (by regulation)
2. Incentives are highest NOW, before demand spikes
3. The window for "planning ahead" is ~18 months

Building a tool to help property owners understand their options. More on that soon.

**CTA:** What questions do you have about Maryland's electrification timeline?

---

### Wednesday — Data
**Hook:** I analyzed 500 calculator submissions. Here's what Maryland property owners are sitting on.

**Body:**
Average incentive eligibility by segment:

• Homeowners (gas heat): $8,000 - $14,000
• Affordable housing: $15,000 - $25,000/unit
• Nonprofits: $25,000 - $100,000+

The kicker? Most don't know these programs exist.

Even fewer know they stack.

EmPOWER + IRA + state grants = 50-100% coverage for qualifying properties.

**CTA:** If you own property in Maryland, reply "check" and I'll send you the calculator link.

---

### Friday — Engagement
**Hook:** Hot take: The biggest risk in Maryland real estate right now isn't interest rates.

**Body:**
It's capex you're not modeling.

ZEHES will require heat pump replacement when your HVAC fails. For buildings with 15+ year old systems, that's a $15-20K/unit expense on the horizon.

Right now, incentives cover 50-70%.

In 3 years? Maybe 20-30%.

The math is simple: act now or pay more later.

**Poll:**
How are you thinking about electrification capex?
- Already planning for it
- On the radar, not urgent
- Not thinking about it yet
- What's ZEHES?

---

## WEEK 2: Establish Expertise

### Monday — Educational
**Hook:** The #1 mistake property owners make with heat pump incentives:

**Body:**
Applying in the wrong order.

Here's the correct sequence for Maryland:

1. EmPOWER pre-approval (utility)
2. IRA HEEHR application (federal)
3. DHCD/MEA grants (state)

Why it matters:

Some programs require pre-approval BEFORE you purchase equipment. Skip this step → lose thousands.

Some programs have annual caps. Apply late in the cycle → reduced funding.

The incentive landscape is complex. That's why I built a calculator that maps it for you.

**CTA:** Link in comments. Takes 2 minutes.

---

### Wednesday — Market Data
**Hook:** BGE vs. Pepco vs. SMECO: Which utility has the best heat pump rebates?

**Body:**
I mapped it:

**BGE:** $3,000 - $8,000 (highest ceiling)
**Pepco:** $2,500 - $7,000
**Potomac Edison:** $2,000 - $6,000
**SMECO:** $2,500 - $5,000

But here's what most people miss:

The utility rebate is just Layer 1.

Layer 2 (Federal IRA): $2,000 - $14,000
Layer 3 (State): $1,000 - $10,000+

Your total depends on income, building type, and application timing.

**CTA:** What utility territory are you in?

---

### Friday — Thought Leadership
**Hook:** Unpopular opinion: Most "heat pump mandate" articles are missing the point.

**Body:**
The story isn't "Maryland is forcing you to buy heat pumps."

The story is: Maryland is PAYING you to buy heat pumps — right now — before they become mandatory.

This is the carrot before the stick.

The incentive window (2024-2027) is designed to make the transition affordable.

After 2027? Programs cap out. Contractor capacity tightens. Prices rise.

The smart move is obvious. The question is whether you'll make it.

**CTA:** What's holding you back from acting now?

---

## WEEK 3: Build Trust

### Monday — Regulatory
**Hook:** Breaking down ZEHES: What Maryland property owners actually need to know

**Body:**
ZEHES = Zero Emission Heating and Equipment Standard

Here's the TL;DR:

When your fossil fuel HVAC reaches "end of life" → replacement must be a heat pump.

What counts as end of life?
• System failure requiring replacement
• System older than [X] years (exact threshold TBD)
• Major renovation triggering permit

When does this apply?
• Phase-in: 2025-2026
• Full enforcement: ~2029

What this means for you:
• Your 20-year-old furnace can't be replaced with another furnace
• Plan now or pay emergency prices later

**CTA:** Questions? Drop them below.

### Wednesday — Personal/Story
**Hook:** Why I left healthcare to build a heat pump calculator.

**Body:**
For 5 years, I was a vascular ultrasound technologist.

My job was pattern recognition — looking at data and making diagnoses.

When I started researching Maryland's electrification market, I saw the same thing:

A diagnostic problem.

Property owners have a condition (regulatory exposure + incentive opportunity) but don't know it.

The information exists. It's just scattered across 15 different programs, websites, and PDFs.

So I built a tool that does the diagnosis for them:
→ Answer 6 questions
→ See which programs you qualify for
→ Get a personalized action plan

No contractors. No sales pitch. Just information.

**CTA:** If you're in Maryland, try it. Link in comments.

---

### Friday — Engagement
**Hook:** I asked 100 Maryland property owners what's stopping them from going electric.

**Body:**
Top 5 answers:

1. "I don't know what I qualify for" (42%)
2. "I don't trust the contractors" (27%)
3. "Heat pumps don't work in cold weather" (myth)
4. "Too expensive" (often wrong after incentives)
5. "My system isn't that old" (valid for some)

The common thread? Information gaps.

Not opposition. Not ideology. Just confusion.

That's a solvable problem.

**CTA:** Which of these resonates with you?

---

## WEEK 4: Segment Focus — Nonprofits

### Monday — Educational
**Hook:** Maryland nonprofits: You're sitting on $25,000 - $100,000 in building grants.

**Body:**
MEA has two programs most 501(c)(3)s don't know about:

**ECB (Electrifying Community Buildings)**
→ Heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, electrical upgrades
→ $10,000 - $50,000+

**EEE (Energy Efficiency Equity)**
→ Insulation, air sealing, efficiency upgrades
→ $5,000 - $25,000+

Who qualifies?
• Churches
• Schools
• Clinics
• Shelters
• Community centers
• Cultural organizations

These are GRANTS, not loans. First-come, first-served.

**CTA:** Know a nonprofit with an old HVAC system? Tag them.

---

### Wednesday — Data
**Hook:** Case study: How a Baltimore church captured $72,000 in grants.

**Body:**
The situation:
• 15,000 sq ft facility
• 25-year-old oil boiler
• $85,000 project cost

The stack:
• MEA ECB Grant: $45,000
• MEA EEE Grant: $15,000
• EmPOWER rebates: $12,000
• **Total grants: $72,000**

Net cost to church: $13,000

Annual energy savings: ~$8,000

Payback: Under 2 years

This is available to most Maryland nonprofits. They just don't know.

**CTA:** I built a free eligibility calculator. Link in comments.

---

### Friday — Engagement
**Hook:** Question for nonprofit leaders:

**Body:**
What's the #1 reason your organization hasn't explored building energy grants?

A) Didn't know they existed
B) Application seems too complicated
C) Other priorities right now
D) Already applied or exploring

I'm trying to understand the barriers so I can help more organizations access this funding.

Drop your answer below — and feel free to DM if you want a confidential conversation.

## WEEK 5: Segment Focus — LIHTC / Affordable Housing

### Monday — Regulatory
**Hook:** Affordable housing owners: The mandate math works in your favor.

**Body:**
Here's why:

Your tenants are income-qualified → IRA HEEHR covers 100% of costs (up to $14K/unit)

Your properties are multifamily → EmPOWER commercial rates apply

You have tax appetite → Additional incentives may apply

Stack them:
• EmPOWER: $4,000-$8,000/unit
• HEEHR: $8,000-$14,000/unit
• DHCD MEEHA: $3,000-$8,000/unit

**Total: $15,000-$30,000/unit**

On a 100-unit portfolio, that's $1.5M-$3M in incentive capture.

The question isn't "if" — it's "when" and "in what order."

**CTA:** What's your Maryland unit count?

---

### Wednesday — Thought Leadership
**Hook:** The PE funds positioning now will own the affordable housing market in 5 years.

**Body:**
Here's the playbook I'm seeing:

1. Acquire properties with aging HVAC (below market pricing due to capex risk)
2. Capture 50-70% incentive coverage on electrification
3. Lock in lower operating costs (heat pumps 2-4x more efficient)
4. Exit with modernized, compliant portfolio at premium

The funds NOT doing this are modeling 2024 costs into 2029 hold periods.

That's a recipe for negative surprises.

**CTA:** If you're in MD multifamily, I built a portfolio assessment tool. DM me.

---

### Friday — Data
**Hook:** I modeled a 500-unit LIHTC portfolio's electrification economics. Here's what I found:

**Body:**
Assumptions:
• 500 units across 8 properties
• Mix of BGE and Pepco territories
• 70% tenant income under 80% AMI
• Average system age: 18 years

Results:
• Gross electrification cost: ~$10M
• Incentive capture: ~$6.5M (65%)
• Net owner investment: ~$3.5M
• Annual energy savings: ~$350K
• Simple payback: ~10 years

But here's the real insight:

Without incentives (waiting until post-2027): Net cost doubles.
With emergency replacements: Net cost triples.

Timing is everything.

**CTA:** Want to run your portfolio? Link in comments.

## WEEK 6: Segment Focus — Homeowners

### Monday — Educational
**Hook:** Maryland homeowners: Here's exactly how to claim your heat pump rebates.

**Body:**
Step-by-step:

**1. Check eligibility** (2 minutes)
Use a calculator to see which programs apply based on your utility, income, and current system.

**2. Get EmPOWER pre-approval**
Contact your utility (BGE, Pepco, etc.) before purchasing equipment.

**3. Choose a participating contractor**
Must be on your utility's approved list for rebates.

**4. Apply for federal rebates**
IRA HEEHR (if income-qualified) or claim 25C on your taxes.

**5. Document everything**
Keep receipts, certification statements, contractor invoices.

**CTA:** Step 1 is the easiest. Calculator link in comments.

---

### Wednesday — Myth Busting
**Hook:** "Heat pumps don't work in Maryland winters."

**Body:**
I hear this constantly. It's wrong.

Modern cold-climate heat pumps work efficiently down to -15°F.

Maryland's coldest days? Usually 10-20°F.

The "heat pumps don't work in cold weather" myth is based on 1980s technology.

Today's units (Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat, Daikin, Fujitsu) are designed for cold climates.

Don't let outdated information cost you $10K+ in incentives.

**CTA:** What other heat pump myths have you heard?

---

### Friday — Engagement
**Hook:** Quick poll for Maryland homeowners:

**Body:**
What's your current heating system?

🔵 Natural gas furnace
🟢 Oil furnace/boiler
🟡 Propane
🔴 Electric baseboard
⚪ Already have a heat pump

Curious about the mix — and happy to share what incentives apply to each.
