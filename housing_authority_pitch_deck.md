### SLIDE 2: The Problem You're Hearing About

**Headline:**
# Your Property Owners Are Confused

**Three columns:**

| They Don't Know | They're Worried About | They Don't Have Time For |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| What programs exist | Emergency HVAC replacements | Researching 5 different programs |
| How much they qualify for | Contractor pressure tactics | Application paperwork |
| When to act | Rising compliance costs | Figuring out the right sequence |

**Footer:**
You're fielding these questions. We can help answer them at scale.

### SLIDE 3: What's Coming

**Headline:**
# Maryland's Electrification Timeline

**Timeline visual:**

```
2024        2025-26        ~2029          2030          2035+
  |            |              |             |             |
  v            v              v             v             v
Zero-      Clean Heat    ZEHES EOL      95% Heat     Near-total
Emission   Rules Begin   Trigger        Pump Sales   Transition
Buildings  Phasing In    Starts         Target
MOU Signed
```

**Key point:**
Property owners who act now capture maximum incentives. Those who wait face emergency pricing and program caps.

## APPENDIX: Talking Points

### If they ask: "What's in it for you?"

> We're building a dataset to help PE funds and policymakers understand Maryland's electrification readiness. The more property owners use the tool, the better our data. We monetize through enterprise intelligence products, not through the free calculator.

### If they ask: "How do I know you won't spam my owners?"

> The property owner gives us their contact info voluntarily. We send exactly three things: an instant SMS confirmation, a PDF report, and one follow-up if they haven't opened it. No sales calls, no contractor referrals, no sharing their info with third parties. They can opt out anytime.

### If they ask: "Can you customize this for our portfolio?"

> Yes. For housing authorities with 500+ units in their network, we can create a custom landing page with your branding and track submissions from your referrals. We can also run aggregate analysis on your portfolio's electrification readiness.

### If they ask: "What happens to the data?"

> Individual data is used only to generate their report. We aggregate anonymized data (utility territory, system age, building type) to track market trends. We never sell individual property owner data or share it with contractors.

## LEAVE-BEHIND: One-Pager

Create a simple one-pager with:

- Headline: "Free Incentive Scan for Your Property Owners"
- QR code linking to calculator
- 3 bullet points: What it is, what they get, no contractors
- Your contact info
- Housing authority can co-brand if desired

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**Color palette suggestion:**
- Primary: Dark blue (#1e3a5f) — trustworthy, institutional
- Accent: Green (#22c55e) — money, positive outcomes
- Background: White or light gray — clean, professional

**Font suggestion:**
- Headers: Arial Bold or Calibri Bold
- Body: Arial or Calibri Regular
- Keep it simple — this is for government/institutional audience

**Visual style:**
- Minimal, clean, no stock photos
- Use tables and simple diagrams
- Numbers should be large and prominent
- Trust signals matter: "no contractors," "free," "neutral"
