# Maryland Heat Pump Rebates & Incentives: Complete 2025 Guide

*Last Updated: [Month Year]*

**Quick Answer:** Maryland homeowners can receive $8,000 to $14,000+ in combined heat pump rebates from utility programs (EmPOWER), federal incentives (IRA), and state grants. Income-qualified households may receive even more.

## What Heat Pump Rebates Are Available in Maryland?

Maryland offers one of the most generous heat pump incentive packages in the country. Here's what's available:

### 1. EmPOWER Maryland Utility Rebates

EmPOWER is Maryland's energy efficiency program, administered through your local utility. Each utility offers different rebate amounts:

| Utility | Heat Pump Rebate | Heat Pump Water Heater | Weatherization |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| BGE | $3,000-$8,000 | $500-$1,500 | Up to $7,500 |
| Pepco | $2,500-$7,000 | $500-$1,200 | Up to $6,000 |
| Potomac Edison | $2,000-$6,000 | $400-$1,000 | Up to $5,000 |
| SMECO | $2,500-$5,000 | $500-$1,000 | Up to $4,000 |

*Note: Amounts vary based on equipment efficiency, home size, and income level. Higher rebates available for income-qualified households.*

**How to qualify:**
- Must be a customer of the utility
- Heat pump must meet efficiency requirements (typically SEER 16+, HSPF 9+)
- Must use a participating contractor
- Some programs require pre-approval

### 2. Federal IRA Rebates & Tax Credits

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created two pathways for federal heat pump incentives:

**Option A: HEEHR Rebates (Income-Qualified)**

The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act provides point-of-sale rebates for income-qualified households:

| Household Income | Rebate Amount | Coverage |
|------------------|---------------|----------|
| Under 80% AMI | Up to $8,000 | 100% of project cost |
| 80-150% AMI | Up to $8,000 | 50% of project cost |
| Over 150% AMI | Not eligible | — |

*AMI = Area Median Income. For a family of 4 in the Baltimore area, 80% AMI is approximately $75,000.*

**Option B: 25C Tax Credit (All Homeowners)**

If you don't qualify for HEEHR rebates, you can claim a tax credit:

- 30% of equipment and installation costs
- Up to $2,000 per year for heat pumps
- Claimed on your federal tax return

**Important:** You can use EmPOWER rebates + federal incentives together, but you cannot double-dip on the same dollar of cost.

### 3. Maryland State Programs

Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) offers additional programs:

- **Residential Clean Energy Grant:** Up to $1,000 for heat pump installation
- **EmPOWER Enhancements:** State supplements to utility rebates for low-income households

## How Much Will You Actually Get?

Here's what typical Maryland homeowners receive:

**Example 1: Middle-Income Homeowner (BGE territory)**
- Heat pump system cost: $15,000
- BGE EmPOWER rebate: $4,000
- Federal 25C tax credit: $2,000
- **Total incentives: $6,000**
- **Net cost: $9,000**

**Example 2: Income-Qualified Homeowner (Pepco territory)**
- Heat pump system cost: $14,000
- Pepco EmPOWER rebate: $5,000
- IRA HEEHR rebate: $8,000
- **Total incentives: $13,000**
- **Net cost: $1,000**

## How to Apply for Maryland Heat Pump Rebates

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

Before you do anything else, find out which programs you qualify for based on:
- Your utility provider
- Your household income
- Your current heating system
- Your home's characteristics

[Link to calculator]

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approval (If Required)

Some programs require pre-approval before you purchase equipment:
- BGE: Pre-approval recommended
- Pepco: Pre-approval required for enhanced rebates
- IRA HEEHR: Will require income verification when available

### Step 3: Choose a Participating Contractor

EmPOWER rebates typically require using a contractor from the utility's approved list. This ensures:
- Proper equipment sizing
- Correct installation
- Rebate paperwork is handled

### Step 4: Complete Installation

Your contractor will:
- Install the heat pump system
- Handle rebate paperwork
- Apply rebate as point-of-sale discount (or you receive check later)

### Step 5: Claim Tax Credits

If using the 25C tax credit:
- Keep all receipts and invoices
- Get a Manufacturer's Certification Statement
- Claim on IRS Form 5695 with your tax return

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do heat pumps work in Maryland winters?

Yes. Modern cold-climate heat pumps work efficiently down to -15°F. Maryland rarely sees temperatures below 10°F, well within heat pump operating range. The "heat pumps don't work in cold weather" myth is based on 1980s technology.

### Can I combine EmPOWER rebates with federal tax credits?

Yes, with limitations. You can use both, but you can't receive more in incentives than you paid. For example, if your system costs $12,000 and you receive $10,000 in EmPOWER + HEEHR rebates, you can only claim a tax credit on the remaining $2,000.

### How long do heat pump rebates last?

EmPOWER programs are funded through 2031. Federal IRA incentives run through 2032. However, program budgets can be exhausted, and rules may change. Current incentive levels are the highest they've ever been.

### What if I have natural gas heating?

You're still eligible for heat pump rebates. In fact, Maryland is specifically incentivizing the switch from gas to electric heat pumps as part of its climate goals. Some programs offer enhanced rebates for fuel-switching.

### Do I need to replace my entire HVAC system?

Not necessarily. Options include:
- **Full replacement:** Replace furnace + AC with heat pump (highest rebates)
- **Dual-fuel:** Add heat pump, keep gas furnace as backup
- **Partial:** Replace window units or add mini-splits

## Why Maryland Is Pushing Heat Pumps

In 2024, Maryland signed the Zero-Emission Buildings Memorandum of Understanding, committing to:
- 65% heat pump market share by 2030
- 90% by 2040
- Near-total building electrification by 2050

The state is using generous incentives now to make the transition affordable before mandates take effect. Property owners who act early capture the best incentives and avoid future compliance costs.

## Next Steps

1. **Check your eligibility:** Use our free calculator to see exactly which programs apply to your home and how much you can receive.

2. **Understand the timeline:** Incentive levels are highest now. As demand increases, program caps may be reached.

3. **Plan your project:** Most homeowners find that heat pump installation makes financial sense when incentives are factored in.
